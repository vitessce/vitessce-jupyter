Python API and Jupyter widget facilitating interactive visualization of spatial single-cell data with [Vitessce](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce).


## Installation

To install with pip:

    $ pip install vitessce

## Getting started

Explore our [example notebooks](./docs/notebooks/).
These contain demos of different use cases and integrations with single-cell data analysis packages.


## Development

For a development installation (requires NodeJS and NPM),

    $ git clone https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python.git
    $ cd vitessce-python
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate vitessce-jupyter-dev
    $ pip install -e .
    $ jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --overwrite --sys-prefix vitessce
    $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix vitessce

When actively developing your extension for JupyterLab, run the command:

    $ jupyter labextension develop --overwrite vitessce

Then you need to rebuild the JS when you make a code change:

    $ cd js
    $ npm run build

You then need to refresh the JupyterLab page when your javascript changes.

### Conda environments

In this repository, there are multiple conda environments for different purposes:

- `vitessce-jupyter-dev` (defined in [environment.yml](./environment.yml)) is used for the development of the `vitessce` package itself
- `vitessce-jupyter-examples` (defined in [docs/notebooks/environment.yml](./docs/notebooks/environment.yml)) is used for running the example notebooks in the `docs/notebooks/` directory (see [`docs/notebooks/README.md`](./docs/notebooks#readme) for more information)
- `vitessce-jupyter-binder` (defined in [binder/environment.yml](./binder/environment.yml)) is the environment used by Binder upon opening notebooks from this repository

## Testing

```sh
cd tests
python -m unittest
```


## Documentation

```sh
make html
```


## Deployment

To deploy a new version, increment the version of the Python package in [`vitessce/_version.py`](./vitessce/_version.py) and the JS package in [`js/package.json`](./js/package.json):

```
cd js
npm version patch
```

Then, when you push or merge the code with the incremented versions to master, the GitHub Action `deploy.yml` workflow will build and push the packages to PyPI and NPM.
